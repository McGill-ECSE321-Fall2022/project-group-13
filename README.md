## Main Scope of the Project
The museum of a small town needs our help designing a website so they can support their community and provide better services. The scope of the software engineering group project of the Fall 2022 ECSE321 course is to support the scenarios described for every stakeholder by developing a software system for managing the services provided by the museum.

In teams of six students, we will gather requirements, design a multi-tier software solution to satisfy those requirements, implement the system, validate that the system is satisfying the requirements, and develop a release pipeline to automate the software delivery process.
